## Introduction

This work is based on the Final Challenge of *DAT203.2x Principles of Machine Learning* course in **Microsoft Professional Program in Data Science(MPP-DS).** In the challenge, we were requested to predict whether a scheduled passenger flight is delayed or not using a binary-classifier.  

However, in this project, I will be using regressor of  gradient boosted decision trees to predict flight delay time in minutes (which can be negative). In particular, I will use XGBoost. It is an algorithm that has recently been dominating applied machine learning and [**Kaggle competitions**](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions) for structured data.
